# NTT Germany Workplace Demos

our demos are in german or english language, there are no limits to provide these solutions in any language.

## RESERVATION and fair use policy
   - please book a slot with [Holger Imbery](mailto:holger.imbery@global.ntt?subject=[nttdemo]%20Booking%20of%20Slot)    
     to use the demo, as parallel demos (*adoption bot & tendfor*) will break your experience,    
     as you will be logged out when a second person starts a session with a Cloud PC.
