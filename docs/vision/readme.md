## Important considerations within your Conversational AI (Voice) Strategy
============

# Before you design a Virtual Assistant platform

- consider 80 % of your Development Work done by your not IT Department therefore Low Code capabilities are critical to scale your further platform
- compare and evaluate the cost/use (Kosten-Nutzen) ratio between use cases build on low code and pro-code bases on cost per transaction
- evaluate the drag and drop experiences of low-code by your users - Question - is it as easy as using PowerPoint and to endure your end users are willing to use it without magjor training cost
- Ensure that your Bot Platforms enable end users besides your Pro-Developers are able to do simple math operation like excel or docs sheets

# Strategic themes were you need a plan

- have a strategy to Empower business users and developers on the same platform
- implement a system to building and keeping a bot up-to-date bot fast. There should be no need for IT or dev teams to deploy code each time a Assistant  is updated.
- Implement a catalog of criteria when you want to to deal with hosting or complex, costly infrastructure. Ensure you can leverage the power of SaaS with his low complexity of infrastructure cost to ensure the possibility of long term scalability - up and down
- you Application need to be available everywhere, therefore you need to consider a Zero trust strategy from day one. Do not stop at the boarders of your Firewall because the Internet is the new WAN (engage with customers/employees on website, mobile app, Facebook, Teams or more, even on there private devices)
- Engage with customers and employees conversationally. Learn how to train your AI inhouse - do not outsource this to 100%. Your Pro Developers need to focus on that process, where you actually build your AI not the Assistant. Which tool do they feel comfortable to support the Business users an most important ensure that you keep the ownership of this trained algorithms because never forget:
  

        #Data is the new gold !


- Start with something simple but not trivial. the complexity is hiding in your process not in the technology. the Weather is trivial, replace a form or a scanned pdf from a sign off process is also simple but not trivial. That´s where the power and expectance comes from. Ask you users though design thinking. You will be surprised what makes sense or not - its always something you never though off
- Do not think you are done after the project. Continuously Improve is the key metrics. Insights help  you what topics to build next. Make long term decision on a platform as you will never be done once you start the AI path.

  - know what connectors you need at day 1 and count connectors you platform is providing you out of the books - Its simple: More is better, even if you do not need them today, who knows what you need next month. This ensures that you can keep pace and ensure futher action
  - If 80 % is low code 20 % is still High Code - ensure that you platform integrates into known Frameworks with SDK´s, Adaptive Dialogs, Cognitive Services etc.
