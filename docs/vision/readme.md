## A Successful Digital Sip Voice Assistant

  - Knowing your customer. 
  - Having accurate, latest and effective content
 - Knowing when to hand off to a human. Understanding the customer’s request and connecting it to the right topic
 - Providing personalized, context-aware help, and taking actions for the customer  

Must have types of conversation: 

| Type Ownership | Question to aks | explaination  |
|-------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Information Ownership |  provides only information | Provide Information. What is…? When will…? Why…? |
| Process Ownership | complete a task | I want to…  How do I…? |
| Business Owner | troubleshoots a problem | Something isn’t working right. I got an error message |

## Before you design a Virtual Assistant platform

- consider 80 % of your Development Work done by your not IT Department therefore Low Code capabilities are critical to scale your further platform
- compare and evaluate the cost/use (Kosten-Nutzen) ratio between use cases build on low code and pro-code bases on cost per transaction
- evaluate the drag and drop experiences of low-code by your users - Question - is it as easy as using PowerPoint and to endure your end users are willing to use it without magjor training cost
- Ensure that your Bot Platforms enable end users besides your Pro-Developers are able to do simple math operation like excel or docs sheets

## Strategic consideration which you need to plan
- have a strategy to Empower business users and developers on the same platform
- implement a system to building and keeping a bot up-to-date bot fast. There should be no need for IT or dev teams to deploy code each time a Assistant  is updated.
- Implement a catalog of criteria when you want to to deal with hosting or complex, costly infrastructure. Ensure you can leverage the power of SaaS with his low complexity of infrastructure cost to ensure the possibility of long term scalability - up and down
- you Application need to be available everywhere, therefore you need to consider a Zero trust strategy from day one. Do not stop at the boarders of your Firewall because the Internet is the new WAN (engage with customers/employees on website, mobile app, Facebook, Teams or more, even on there private devices)
- Engage with customers and employees conversationally. Learn how to train your AI inhouse - do not outsource this to 100%. Your Pro Developers need to focus on that process, where you actually build your AI not the Assistant. Which tool do they feel comfortable to support the Business users an most important ensure that you keep the ownership of this trained algorithms because never forget:

  #Data is the new gold !
- Start with something simple but not trivial. the complexity is hiding in your process not in the technology. the Weather is trivial, replace a form or a scanned pdf from a sign off process is also simple but not trivial. That´s where the power and expectance comes from. Ask you users though design thinking. You will be surprised what makes sense or not - its always something you never though off
- Do not think you are done after the project. Continuously Improve is the key metrics. Insights help  you what topics to build next. Make long term decision on a platform as you will never be done once you start the AI path.

  - know what connectors you need at day 1 and count connectors you platform is providing you out of the books - Its simple: More is better, even if you do not need them today, who knows what you need next month. This ensures that you can keep pace and ensure futher action
  - If 80 % is low code 20 % is still High Code - ensure that you platform integrates into known Frameworks with SDK´s, Adaptive Dialogs, Cognitive Services etc.

# Pick your scalable Gateway for integrating bots and cognitive voice services / telephone number to your bot using AudioCodes

The Voice Engagement Channel component is based  Gateway embedded and feature-rich session border controller (SBC) module. It is responsible for interfacing with almost any voice engagement channel, as shown in the figure below. This component inherits all the SBC capabilities, for example, SIP interoperability, media handling (including translation), security, high availability, and scalability. The Voice Engagement Channel component processes the SIP signaling and media (RTP) traffic and then converts the traffic into HTTP, which it routes to specific bots residing on  specific bot frameworks.

The Voice.AI Gateway's Cognitive Service component interfaces with third-party, cloudbased chatbot services, which include bot frameworks, speech-to-text (STT) engines, and 
text-to-speech (TTS) engines. The Voice.AI Gateway implements a multi-chatbot platform 
approach, enabling the use of different chatbot services based on dialed (called) number.
Integration and support for these multi-bot frameworks and speech services is done through 
HTTP-based APIs, which convert any SIP event into the bot framework API, and vice versa. 
The Voice.AI Gateway's Cognitive Service component thus orchestrates the stream flow 
between the bot framework, STT engine and TTS engine.

The Voice.AI Gateway uses third-party text-to-speech (TTS) engines to convert text, sent 
from the bot into speech, which it then plays to the user. 
The Voice.AI Gateway supports the following third-party TTS services:

- Azure Speech Services

The Voice.AI Gateway uses third-party speech-to-text (STT) engines to convert audio 
(speech) spoken by the chatbot user, into text, which it sends to the bot.
The Voice.AI Gateway supports the following third-party STT service providers:
- Azure Speech Services

The Voice.AI Gateway connects to bots through one of the following third-party chatbot 
frameworks:

- Microsoft Azure Bot Framework (using Direct Line 3.0 API)

The Voice.AI Gateway adapts to the above-mentioned bot framework's APIs. In addition, the 
Voice.AI Gateway provides a proprietary exposed HTTP-based APIs that allows any bot 
frameworks or middlewares to connect with it over HTTP/S. For a detailed description on 
the Voice.AI Gateway's APIs, contact AudioCodes

CDRs and Call Transcripts
The Voice.AI Gateway can be enabled (default) to store call detail records (CDRs) of live 
and history chatbot calls on a local database. They can be viewed by connecting to the 
Voice.AI Gateway's Web-based management interface. Below shows an example of CDRs 
for historical chatbot call

he Voice.AI Gateway can also be enabled (default) to store chatbot call transcripts (speech to-text) on a local database. You can view the transcripts by connecting to the Voice.AI 
Gateway's Web-based management interface. Below shows an example of the transcript of 
a live chatbot call.
